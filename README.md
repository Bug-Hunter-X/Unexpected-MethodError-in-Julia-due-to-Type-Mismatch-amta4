# Julia Type-Related MethodError

This repository demonstrates a common error in Julia programming:  `MethodError` exceptions arising from type mismatches.  The example showcases a simple function that fails when provided with an unexpected data type. The solution highlights how to add type checking to prevent this error.

The file `bug.jl` contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.jl` provides a corrected version with robust type handling.
